/**
 * @description This is a test to see how well you understand data types in javascript.
 * Write your solutions right below the comments. Use any tools you need to check the answers
 *
 * Don't remove the comments, Ed needs to know what's going on.
 *
 * As tempting as it may be, don't look in the previous exercises for answers. I don't care if you can open them.
 * I care if you can do these yourself ðŸ˜Š
 *
 * If you get stuck on a task - that's good. It means that we're not wasting time here.
 * Note it and skip it. We will later cover it in a 1x1 session and make sure you udnerstand it :P

// 1. create a constant called 'pi' and assign it the value of 3.14
const pi = 3.14;
// 2 create a variable called 'radius' and assign it the value of 10
let radius = 10;
// 2.1 now, change its value to 20
radius = 20;
console.log(radius);
// 3. create a variable called 'area' and calculate the area using your variables
//   The formula is: area = pi x radius-squared
let area = pi * Math.pow(radius, 2);
console.log(area);
// 4. Create an array called 'garage' with these cars inside:
//   - volvo
//   - audi
//   - mercedes
//   - bmw

const garage = ["volvo", "audi", "mercedes", "bmv"];

// Now, without manually typing the array:
// 4.1 add 'ferrari' to the garage
garage.push("ferrari");
console.log(garage);
// 4.2 remove Mercedes from the array
garage.splice(2, 1);
console.log(garage);
// 4.3 replace the 2nd car in the array with 'lada'
garage[1] = "lada";
console.log(garage);
// 4.4 create an array with all of the cars in the garage capitalized

const carsToUpperCase = garage.map((cars) => cars.toString().toUpperCase());
console.log(carsToUpperCase);
// 4.5 find the volvo. pretend you don't know what the array looks like.
const findVolvo = garage.find((car) => (car = "volvo"));
console.log(findVolvo);
// 5 Create an object called 'myself' with these properties and assign them your values.
// Use appropriate datatypes for the values:
//   - name
//   - age
//   - isHungry
//   - favouriteAnimal

const mySelf = {
  name: "Visard",
  age: "29",
  isHungry: true,
  favouriteAnimal: "Dolphin",
};
console.log(mySelf);

// 5.1 Replace the favouriteAnimal with 'turtle'
mySelf.favouriteAnimal = "turtle";

  address: {
    city: "Tirana",

  favouriteAnimal: "Dolphin",
  favouriteFoods: ["Pilaf", "Fasule", "Asude"],
  address: {
    city: "Tirana",
    country: "Albania",
    streetName: "Rruga",
  },

console.log(mySelf2);

// 5.3 remove the age property
delete mySelf.age;
console.log(mySelf);
// 5.4 Have a snack. Set isHungry to false (even if you're not really hungry).
mySelf.isHungry = false;
console.log(mySelf);
// 5.5 Add a function to the object called 'eat'. It should take a food as an argument and return "Name ate food!"
// That's a mouthful, so here's an example:
// e.g. calling the eat function with a banana argument, in an object where the name is 'Nico' should return "Nico ate banana!"
// e.g. calling the eat function with an apple argument, in an object where the name is 'Ilir' should return "Ilir ate apple!"
function eat(name, foods) {
  for (const food of foods) {
    console.log(`${name} eat ${food}`);
